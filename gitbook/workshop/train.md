# Train

#### Step 1:

To Train we need some data. 

Download the following.

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/flooded-neighborhood.zip" caption="" %}

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/suburban-neighborhood.zip" caption="" %}

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/rooftop-survivors.zip" %}

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/rescueboats.zip" %}

We use the `testdata` in a moment to test our model.

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/testdata.zip" %}

#### Step 2: 

Click on browse and select the 4 zip files

#### Step 3: 

Give the model a name. I am calling mine `flooded-region-recognizer` 

#### Step 4: 

Click `Create a class` to create three classes. I am calling mine, `flooded`, `resuce_boat` and `rooftop_survivors` .

#### Step 5: 

Drag the .zip files from left into the classes. Use the `subarban-neighborhood` as `negative`

#### Step 6:

Click `Train Model` . The training can take up to 10 minutes.
