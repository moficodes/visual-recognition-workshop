# Workshop

The workshop should take about 30-35 mins.

We will use a few services.

1. Watson Studio. This is where the magic happens. We will create a custom image recognition model.
2. Visual Recognition. It is very difficult to train an image recognition model from scratch. So we start from the already amazing watson visual recognition as base and train on our specific images on top.
3. Object storage. The images and model need a space to be stored in. We use cloud object storage to have a secure and reliable storage for our image assets and model files.
