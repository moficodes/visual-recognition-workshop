> ### Caution
>
> When many people try to sign up from the same ip such as a public wifi in this workshop environment the system catches that as a spam. Since our lite account also do not have a credit card requirement, that is the best way we have to stop spam accounts being created. It's not perfect. But we would rather give people access to a lite account than force people to connect their credit card.

To avoid getting locked out

* If possible use some sort of hotspot or ask your workshop lead.
* Use incognito window. 
* Use a VPN
